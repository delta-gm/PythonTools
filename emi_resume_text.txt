As an AV engineer, I was the subject matter expert for Fusion conference room systems. I solved a persistent five-year problem by exploring the issues and implementing self-cleaning database solutions to greatly increase the reliability of this globally implemented, on-premises system. After a database rebuild to eliminate corrupt data, my solution has kept the system stable for two years.
